## Installation

### pip

Corpuscula supports Python 3.5 or later. To install it via pip, run:
```bash
pip install stanza
```

If you currently have a previous version of `corpuscula` installed, use:
```bash
pip install stanza -U
```

### From Source

Alternatively, you can also install `corpuscula` from source of this git
repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fostroll/corpuscula.git
cd corpuscula
pip install -e .
```

## Setup

After installation, you'd like to specify a root path where you prefer to store
downloading corpuses:
```python
>>> import corpuscula.corpus_utils as cu
>>> cu.set_root_path(<path>)  # We will keep corpuses here
```

If you'll not do it, `corpuscula` will try to keep corpuses in the directory
where you installed it.
