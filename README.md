## Installation

### pip

Corpuscula supports Python 3.5 or later. To install it via pip, run:
```sh
$ pip install stanza
```

If you currently have a previous version of `corpuscula` installed, use:
```sh
$ pip install stanza -U
```

### From Source

Alternatively, you can also install `corpuscula` from source of this git
repository:
```sh
S git clone https://github.com/fostroll/corpuscula.git
S cd corpuscula
S pip install -e .
```

## Setup

After installation, you'd like to specify a root path where you prefer to store
downloading corpuses:
```python
>>> import corpuscula.corpus_utils as cu
>>> cu.set_root_dir(<path>)  # We will keep corpuses here
```
NB: it will create/update config file `.rumor` in your home directory.

If you'll not do it, `corpuscula` will try to keep corpuses in the directory
where you installed it.

## Usage

### CONLL-U support

The class `Conllu` promotes full CONLL-U format support (including CONLL-U
Plus). The description of CONLL-U format you can find on [Universal
Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html) project site.
In `corpuscula`, internal representation of CONLL-U file is [Parsed
CONLL-U](https://github.com/fostroll/corpuscula/blob/master/resources/docs/TUTORIAL_PARSED_CONLLU.md)
format.

#### Conllu class methods

NB: All methods of class are static. All returns are generators. All input
lists may be generators, too.

`Conllu.from_sentences(cls, sentences, fix=True, split_multi=False,
                       adjust_for_speech=False, columns=None)`
