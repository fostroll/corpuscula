`Items` is just a toy database that keeps in memory arrays of entities of
different categories with their attributes. Really, you can just construct
your own objects of that type and save them via `pickle`. `Items` is just a
useful wrapper for that that we use for keeping the data of named entity
domain.

### Usage

The simplest way to create an `Items` database is just run its constructor
without params:
```python
from corpuscula import Items
items = Items()
```
See below for the parameters of the constructor.

Then, you can load data to `Items`:
```python
items.load(items, items_class=None, update=False, encoding='utf-8-sig',
           log_file=sys.stderr)
```
Param **item** is usually a *dict* ({**item**: {attr: val}}), but it can also
be a *list* or *set* of **item** constants. In the latter case they will be
transformed to the *dict* of {**item**: {}}.

While loading, orig **item** will be copied to its attributes with a key =
`None`, and if the **item** is of `str` type, then its key in **items** will
be replaced to lowercase version of **items**. It's done for not to keep one
entiny twice in different character cases.

**NB:** It's your burden to care of the absence of such duplicates in the data
of **items**. During loading, they will be silently replaced by the last one.

**items_class** is just a `str` name of the category for your **items** data.
If the category with that name is already present in `Items`, you should to
set the **update** parameter to `True`. You'll get an error elsewise.

**NB:** `None` is a valid value for the **items_class**.

**log_file** specifies a stream for progress messages. Default is
`sys.stderr`. If **log_file**=`None`, all output will be suppressed.

After loading, you can read the data kept:
```python
items.get(items_class=None, item=None, copy=True)
```
If **copy** is `True` (default), you'll get a full copy of the data requested.
In that case, changing that data has no effect on the original. But if you
exactly plan to change the data, specify **copy**=`False`. Also, you'd like to
use **copy**=`False` to speed up your pipeline.

if **item** is `None` (default), you'll get all the **item_class** category as
the return.

**NB**: The `Items` doesn't have methods for changing or removal **item** or
**item_class** keys. So far, we didn't see a necessity of it.

You can check if a certain **item** is present in a certain **item_class**:
```python
items.item_isknown(self, item, item_class)
```

Anytime, you can backup and restore current state of a `Items` object:
```python
o = items.backup()
cdict.restore(o)

items.backup_to(file_path)
items.restore_from(file_path)
```

The constructor of a `Items` class allows restore and backup data right in the
moment of an object creation:
```python
items = Items(restore_from=None, backup_to=None)
```
Params **restore_from** and **backup_to** allow to specify file paths for
loading and saving `Items` data. The constructor firstly restore data, and 
only after that backup it.

If need, you can check if current state of a `Items` object does not contain
any information:
```python
if items.isempty():
    [...]
```

### Russian Names Database

As an example of usage of `Items`, we put to the root of our github
***Corpuscula*** directory a csv-file (in Russian) with a list of person's
names (see `names.zip` file). We can't find names database anywhere, so we
just grab the data from open resouces (mostly, it's some war heroes and smth
like that, so we have a strong bias to the male side). We also put there the
script `load_names.py` to convert that data to `Items` databases. The script
is complex, but the meaning of it, that we detect a gender of person by it's
patronym. As a result, we got lists of unique names, patronyms and surnames
together with their genders and numbers of occurences. If a name is unisex, we
also keep the number of occurences for every gender.

By default, script set thresholds of `5` for names and patronym, and of `3`
for surnames. That means that if any item was met less times than that
threshold, we remove it. We also consider this param when make conclusion
about name's gender. E.g.: if we met that name as female `2` times and as male
`10` times, that we count the name as male and just remove it's "female part".
The total number of occurences for that case we set to `10`.

We need such pruning because the names we got contain a lot of mistypes. 
Even set threshold to `2` decrease names and patronyms thrice (number of
surnames decreases twice). But, maybe, it's worth to keep all mistakes.
Because, if someone make them once, you can meet them again... Anyhow, we put
to the ***Corpuscula*** root directory the original `names.zip` along with our
pruned `Items` files. We separate surnames from names and patronyms and store
it to  `surnames.pickle` file. Names and patronyms you can find in
`names.pickle` file.

If you need your own version of names' database, you can change arguments of
the call of the function `load_names_db` at the bottom of the `load_names.py`
script and re-run it.
